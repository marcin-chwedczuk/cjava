- Formatting methods + integration tests
- Method parameter names should be taken from AST structure.
    Compute them either at decompiling time or as a separate pass
    after decompilation.
- Decompilation of static constructors
- Class block initializers and static initializers
- Constants for static/const fields e.g. `public static final int = 32`
